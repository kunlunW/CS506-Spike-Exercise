# CS506-Spike-Exercise
In order to run the BadgerByte website on your local computer you will first need to install XAMPP at https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html. Once XAMPP is installed open the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL servers. The names will be highlighted green once the servers are successfully started. Next, install node.js at  https://nodejs.org/en/download/. Next, download the repo into xampp/htdocs. Once the repo is installed in a folder in the htdocs directory the backend and frontend servers will need to be started. To load necessary modules for the backend cd into xampp/htdocs/<repo-name>/backend and run the commands, "npm install react-scripts@latest", "npm i express --save", and "npm i request --save". To start the backend run "node App.js" from the same directory. To load the necessary modules for the front end cd into xampp/htdocs/<repo-name>/badgerbyte and run the commands "npm install react-scripts@latest" and "npm i axios --save". Now run the frontend by entering the command: "npm start". The website should now load in your browser.
